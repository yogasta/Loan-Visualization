# Loan-Visualization
This project focuses on exploring a loan dataset from a certain company and visualizing it in Python using its libraries and Tableau dashboard.

The general objective of this repository is to see if there is any useful insights that a loan company could use to see if there are a specific variables that can help in determining if a loan should be approved or not, and to see if there are any potential from a certain demographic group that the loan company can capitalize on.

The general problem statements in this project are:


1. **Loan Approval Rates**: The primary goal is to identify which factors influence loan approval. Understanding these factors will help us predict future loan approval possibilities.

2. **Demographic Analysis**: We aim to investigate the role of demographic variables, such as gender, marital status, education, and property area, in loan approval. The objective is to identify any potential disparities among different demographic groups.

3. **Credit History Impact**: Another important aspect is understanding the influence of credit history on loan approval. We assume applicants with a good credit history are more likely to get their loans approved, but the analysis will confirm this.

4. **Income vs. Loan Amount**: We plan to analyse the relationship between an applicant's income (including co-applicant income) and the loan amount requested. This will help us to understand if there's a correlation.

5. **Loan Amount Distribution**: Investigating the distribution of loan amounts could reveal any skewness or anomalies that need to be addressed in the loan-granting process.

6. **Role of Dependents**: We will also examine whether the number of dependents an applicant has affects their chance of loan approval.

Through these problem statements, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the loan approval process.
