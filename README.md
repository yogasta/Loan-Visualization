# Loan-Visualization
## This repository is created by Prayoga Agusto Haradi from batch HCK-004 from Hacktiv8 for the purpose of Talent Fair 5.


[Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/prayoga.haradi/viz/TalentFair5Final/Dashboard2?publish=yes) dashboard can be found here.


This project focuses on exploring a loan dataset from a certain company and visualizing it in Python using its libraries and Tableau dashboard.

The general objective of this repository is to see if there is any useful insights that a loan company could use to see if there are a specific variables that can help in determining if a loan should be approved or not, and to see if there are any potential from a certain demographic group that the loan company can capitalize on.

The general problem statements in this project are:


1. **Loan Approval Rates**: The primary goal is to identify which factors influence loan approval. Understanding these factors will help us predict future loan approval possibilities.

2. **Demographic Analysis**: We aim to investigate the role of demographic variables, such as gender, marital status, education, and property area, in loan approval. The objective is to identify any potential disparities among different demographic groups.

3. **Credit History Impact**: Another important aspect is understanding the influence of credit history on loan approval. We assume applicants with a good credit history are more likely to get their loans approved, but the analysis will confirm this.

4. **Income vs. Loan Amount**: We plan to analyse the relationship between an applicant's income (including co-applicant income) and the loan amount requested. This will help us to understand if there's a correlation.

5. **Loan Amount Distribution**: Investigating the distribution of loan amounts could reveal any skewness or anomalies that need to be addressed in the loan-granting process.

6. **Role of Dependents**: We will also examine whether the number of dependents an applicant has affects their chance of loan approval.

Through these problem statements, this project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of the loan approval process.

Based on all of the visualization that we have done, the following conclusions can be made:

- **Education**: Our data indicates that married applicants and those with a graduate level education tend to have a higher chance of loan approval. This information can be used in risk assessment and marketing strategies. We might consider promoting our loan products more heavily to these demographic groups.

- **Credit History**: As we expected, a good credit history significantly improves an applicant's chances of getting their loan approved. This emphasizes the importance of continuing to make credit history a crucial factor in our loan approval process.

- **Property Area**: It's interesting to note that applicants from semiurban areas have a higher loan approval rate. This could indicate potential growth areas for our company, suggesting we may want to increase our marketing efforts or branch presence in these regions.

- **Income and Loan Amount**: Our analysis shows that higher income applicants are more likely to be approved for a loan, and a high loan-to-income ratio often results in loan rejection. This finding confirms the importance of assessing the applicant's ability to repay, suggesting that we should maintain or even tighten our income verification standards and we could adjust our loan-to-income ratio guidelines if necessary.

- **Dependents**: Although we need more data to be certain, our current analysis suggests that having two dependents may increase the chance of loan approval. While more research is needed, we should not overlook the role of family size in our loan-granting process.
